Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure
Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model. This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

#Summary

The Project focuses on building and optimizing using Linear Regression

Scikit-learn Pipeline
Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.

What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose? Efficient Model Training

What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose? TO View and analyze results

AutoML
In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML. C, max-iter, taks, primary metrix, number of cross validation

Pipeline comparison
Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one? hypermodel and auto ml

Future work
What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?
